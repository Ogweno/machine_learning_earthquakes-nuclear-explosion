## Separate Earthquake Signals from Nuclear Explosions

### Basic Information:
In this project, I aim to classify earthquake signals from nuclear explosions. Both earthquakes and nuclear explosions generate seismic waves that can be detected thousands of kilometers away. However, it is not always an easy
task to separate them from each other. Although seismologists have developed methods, it is sometimes very challenging. 
For example, a recent 3.4 magnitude quake from North Korea was interpreted as 'suspected explosion' but later identified as natural.

The primary objective is to develop machine learning models to separate natural earthquakes from nuclear explosions.
